# Learn_MERN
A repository to learn how to use the MERN stack through F8 (fullstack.edu.vn)

## What is the MERN stack?
MERN is a pre-built technology stack based on JavaScript technologies. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.
- MongoDB — document database
- Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
- React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
- Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server (runtime)

## How does the MERN stack work?
The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a three-tier architecture (front end, back end, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.

## MVC Framework Architecture
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller
